# Book Inventory Management System

## Overview
This Book Inventory Management System is built using **Django** and **Django REST Framework** to provide a robust, scalable solution for managing a collection of books. The system allows users to add, update, and delete book records, filter books based on various criteria, and export data in CSV or JSON formats. Itâ€™s designed to be easily extendable and integrates security layers to ensure the safe handling of data.

## Features
- Add, edit, and delete books
- Filter books by title, author, genre, or publication date
- Export books as CSV or JSON files
- Built-in security and scalability using Django REST Framework
- Uses SQLite for quick setup but can easily be migrated to other relational databases
